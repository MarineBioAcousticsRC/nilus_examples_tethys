This repository will hold example scripts for generating xml files using Nilus which can then be uploaded to Tethys. These scripts can be modified based on your data structure and goals. Please upload any scripts that you write for this purpose as well!
For more information on Tethys, see: https://tethys.sdsu.edu/documentation/

The Nilus documentation contains additional examples and tutorials as well as documentation of the application programming interface which lists all Nilus classes and the methods associated with them. 

Be sure that you are using the versions of the client libraries that correspond to your Tethys server. 

The Nilus version can be checked by looking at the filename of the Nilus jar file.  Relative to the installation folder, the file should be in NilusXMLGenerator\target\nilus-X.Y.jar where X.Y is the version number.
The Tethys server can be checked by using the following URL in a web browser:  your.tethys.server:9779/Tethys/version where your.tethys.server is replaced with the domain name of your server (e.g., localhost or tethys.noaa.gov).
